# Audio-Profanity-Filter
Filter out profanity/foul words from the audio along with retain the quality of an audio.

# PROBLEM TACKLED-
1. No audio censorship for game streaming.
2. Podcasts and the list goes on â€¦...
3. Requires all sorts of manual audio censorships which actually is time consuming.

# Solution-
1.NLP based profanity filtering 
2. Via Google Cloud Speech To Text, we are detecting timestamps of foul words and then removing them while retaining the person's audio quality. 
3. We make use of audio processing techniques to beep out the foul words thus retaining sound quality of person.


TECH STACK-----
    
   1. Google Cloud Speech To Text in Python.
   
   2. Audio Pre-Processing in Python PyAudio, ffmpeg and PyDub.
   
   Valuability in various fields------
   All the entertainment based industries that make use of audio streaming that is almost all of them. Like :
  1.Podcasts & Youtube Online
  2.Gaming---Adding Child Filters.
